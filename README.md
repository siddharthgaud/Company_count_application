# Company_count_application
A web-based application that provides user authentication features, allowing users to log in or register. Designed for managing and analyzing company-related data efficiently with a clean and user-friendly interface.


While working on the assignment, I encountered an issue during the integration with PostgreSQL and virtual environment. To ensure timely completion, I switched to SQLite as the database and local environment  for this project. This change does not affect the core functionality of the application, and all the requirements specified in the test have been implemented and tested.
